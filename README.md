## Description

This application is a very straightforward backend for e-commerce sites. It allows you to designate products, categories and tags in an interrelational database. You can post a product using the product_name, price, stock, and tagIds fields:

You can input a category by using the category_name in the category route:

You can also insert new tags using the tag_name property in your tag route:

 From here you can build your backend and front end to reference these routes. Thank you for using this app.
